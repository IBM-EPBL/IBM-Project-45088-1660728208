<li>For the fertilizer recommendation application, the user can input the soil data and the type of crop they are growing, and the application will predict what the soil lacks or has excess of and will recommend improvements.</li>
<li>For the last application, that is the plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.</li>
<li>These all are to improve the Agriculture, thatâ€™s slightly reduces the poverty, climatic condition, soil erosion etc ...</li></ul><br></div>
